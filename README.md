## Description

The InFlow platform is a fintech solution that allows businesses to manage their finances and issue corporate cards to employees. The platform has two user roles: Owner and Employee, each with its own set of features and permissions.

The platform will be built using a MERN stack with a Postgres database and hosted on Oracle Cloud in a Saudi Arabian data center. The Web app will use React.js with Redux for state management, and the mobile app will use Flutter for both iOS and Android. The platform will be API-driven, with the API documented using Swagger.

The deployment process will use GitLab's CI/CD flows to automate the building, and deploying of code to the various environments. Hosting and deployment details are provided in separate sections of the BRD.

Overall, the Inflow platform aims to provide businesses with a comprehensive solution for managing their finances, from neat finance management to transaction tracking and approvals, all in one place.
